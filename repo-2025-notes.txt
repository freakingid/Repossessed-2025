== Optimizations
=========================================================
1. Using a pool of instances that is initialized at game startup, then moved off screen or whatever rather than deleted when the ghost / etc is destroyed. Idea is to save the overhead of allocating new instances. Is this helpful?

2. Something with Tile collisions. Instead of a collision box for every 64x64 tile, can we have a collision box, and stretch it into a rectangle over a long span of boxes? Is this helpful?
